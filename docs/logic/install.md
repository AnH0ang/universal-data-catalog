# Install Package


To install `universal-data-catalog` simply run:

```
pip install universal-data-catalog
```

# Install with Extras

If you want to use a `pandas` data frame in combination with the data catalog, you need to specify `pandas` as an extra dependency.
It is not shipped with the package by default. To do this, simply run the following command.

```
pip install universal-data-catalog[pandas]
```

Other extras are also available.
The extras that are currently available are:

* `pandas`
* `networkx`

```
pip install universal-data-catalog[extra1,extra2,...]
```
